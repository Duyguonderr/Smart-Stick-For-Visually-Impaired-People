# Smart-Stick-For-Visually-Impaired-People
The Smart Guide Stick project aims to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals.
# Summary:
The Smart Guide Stick project aims to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. This assistive device integrates sensors and communication modules to detect obstacles, adjust lighting, and communicate emergency signals. The stick is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, a buzzer for audible alerts, an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) for ambient light detection, and a Bluetooth module for communication with a mobile application.
The device provides real-time feedback to the user about nearby obstacles through sound, adjusts the LED brightness for better visibility at night, and sends an emergency SOS message that contains their location via Bluetooth which communicates with a smartphone application. This comprehensive solution improves the independence and safety of visually impaired individuals by providing multiple layers of feedback and communication.
# Hardware Components:
Microcontroller: An Arduino or similar microcontroller capable of handling multiple interrupts.
Ultrasonic Sensor: HC-SR04 sensors or similar, known for their reliability and accuracy.
Buzzer: A small, loud buzzer to provide audible alerts.
LDR: Light Dependent Resistor.
LED: High-brightness LED.
Battery: A rechargeable battery with a capacity sufficient for extended use.
Bluetooth Module: For communication with a mobile app.
Resistors: Assorted values (e.g., 10kΩ for LDR pull-down, 330kΩ for LED).
Battery: Rechargeable battery (9V).
Connecting Wires: Male-to-female and male-to-male jumper wires.
Breadboard: For prototyping.
# Functional Requirements:
Detect obstacles using ultrasonic sensor.
Provide immediate feedback through audible alerts.
Ensure the system operates in real-time with minimal delay.
Implement efficient power management for prolonged use.
Allow the guide stick to function independently without smartphone integration.
Bluetooth communication for sending SMS which contains SOS and their location to their relatives via smartphone application to inform for potential emergency cases.
Adjusts the LED brightness for better visibility at night.
